;;=============================================================
;;  Name:
;;============================================================

;;  In this file, you must implement the 'INSERTION_SORT' subroutine.

;;  Little reminder from your friendly neighborhood 2110 TA staff: don't run
;;  this directly by pressing 'Run' in complx, since there is nothing put at
;;  address x3000. Instead, call the subroutine by doing the following steps:
;;      * 'Debug' -> 'Simulate Subroutine Call'
;;      * Call the subroutine at the 'INSERTION_SORT' label
;;      * Add the [arr (addr), length] params separated by a comma (,) 
;;        (e.g. x4000, 5)
;;      * Proceed to run, step, add breakpoints, etc.
;;      * INSERTION_SORT is an in-place algorithm, so if you go to the address
;;        of the array by going to 'View' -> 'Goto Address' -> 'Address of
;;        the Array', you should see the array (at x4000) successfully 
;;        sorted after running the program (e.g [2,3,1,1,6] -> [1,1,2,3,6])

;;  If you would like to setup a replay string (trace an autograder error),
;;  go to 'Test' -> 'Setup Replay String' -> paste the string (everything
;;  between the apostrophes (')) excluding the initial " b' ". If you are 
;;  using the Docker container, you may need to use the clipboard (found
;;  on the left panel) first to transfer your local copied string over.

;;      if (length <= 1) {
;;        return;
;;      }
;;  
;;      INSERTION_SORT(arr, length - 1);
;;  
;;      int last_element = arr[length - 1];
;;      int n = length - 2;
;;  
;;      while (n >= 0 && arr[n] > last_element) {
;;          arr[n + 1] = arr[n];
;;          n--;
;;      }
;;  
;;      arr[n + 1] = last_element;
;;  }
